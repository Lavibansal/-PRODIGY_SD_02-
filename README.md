# Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based guessing game implemented in C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is challenged to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It continues until the user successfully guesses the number, displaying the total number of attempts taken.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User-friendly prompts and feedback.
- Keeps track of the number of attempts.
- Congratulatory message upon guessing the correct number.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic knowledge of how to run a C++ program from the command line or an IDE.
